# News-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Predicting-Next-Day-Stock-Movements
This project studies whether financial news can predict next-day stock movement (Up / Down / NoChange). We compare **sentiment-based baselines** (VADER, FinBERT sentiment) vs **direct text modeling** with FinBERT embeddings and limited fine-tuning.
